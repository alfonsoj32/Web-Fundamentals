    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Alfonso Tumbokon. I'm a software engineering major and a sophomore at BYU-I.</p>

    <p>My hobbies are playing video games, card and board games, reading books, and computer related stuff.</p>

    <p>I'm not married.</p>

    <p>I'm taking this course, so I can learn more about creating websites.</p>

    <p>I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints since I was 8 years old.</p>

    <p>My favorite scripture is Ether 12:27 "And if men come unto me I will show unto them their 
    aweakness. I bgive unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my cgrace is sufficient for 
    all men that dhumble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have 
    faith in me, then will I make eweak things become strong unto them."</p>
